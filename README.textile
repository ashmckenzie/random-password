h1. Random password generator

Occasionally have the need to generate random passwords, specifically excluding certain nasty characters so I whipped this bad boy up.

Hope it proves useful to someone out there :)

h2. Gems used

* "trollop":http://gitorious.org/trollop
* "rspec":https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec
* "rcov":https://github.com/relevance/rcov

h2. Install

Run @bundle install@ to install necessary gems.

h2. Usage

Running @run.rb@ will produce three random passwords that are eight characters in length by default.

  ./run.rb

	q0Raubgj
	pSpH8EVH
	KDaAkTu7

You can also generate more 'huamn' random passwords by passing the @--human@ parameter, which will select three random passwords that are eight characters in length by default.  The more 'human' passwords are randomly generated by selecting a number of random words from @dict.txt@, cutting them in half and then appending them to each other until the sedesired password length is achieved.

  ./run.rb --human

  nathengr
  bibiobar
  axiomtrm

h2. Help

There are plenty of options, execute @./run.rb --help@ to see them all: -

  ./run.rb --help
  Options:
           --help, -h:   Help
